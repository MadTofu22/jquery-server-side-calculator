# MadTofu's Marvelous Math Manipulator

## Description

This project hopes to accomplish one thing, provide the user with a basic calculator.

On a deeper level this project is being developed by a student. In the past week I have learned how to use Node, Express with Body Parser, and Ajax. This project is a weekend challange designed to demonstrate these new skills, reinforce my understanding of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Git, and further my knowledge base by learning how to deploy an app on Heroku.
