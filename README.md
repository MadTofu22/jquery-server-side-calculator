# MadTofu's Marvelous Math Manipulator

## Description

This project hopes to accomplish one thing, provide the user with a basic calculator.

On a deeper level this project is being developed by a student. In the past week I have learned how to use Node, Express with Body Parser, and Ajax. This project is a weekend challange designed to demonstrate these new skills, reinforce my understanding of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Git, and further my knowledge base by learning how to deploy an app on Heroku.

3. Click on one of the operator buttons to select the mathmatical operation you need. The operators buttons will become disabled after one is selected to prevent an invalid input.
4. Use the number buttons, and decimal point if needed, to enter the second number. The decimal point will become disabled after use to prevent an invalid input.
5. Use the = button to submit the calculation. Or use the C button to clear the input and start over.
6. After submitting the calculation the equation will be removed and replaced with the answer and the history will be updated to show the last calculation.
7. You can then use the answer in the next calulation or start over by using the C button.

- At any point, you may click on a calculation in the history list to re-run that calculation. This will add it to the history again as if a new calculation was ran.
